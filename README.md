# MP-Assortment

## TODO List

- [ ] Brand-and-bound (B&B) algorithm as a multi-dimensional line search. (very promising)
- [ ] Parallelize B&B.
- [ ] General nonlinear solvers.
- [ ] Advanced numerical techniques to efficiently compute $P(u+X>max(w,Y))$ (might be very difficult).
- [ ] Makw sure the data types pf all outputs of functions are not numpy-related. [NOT PRIORITIZED]
